## Features

- **Live rendering** — headings, bold, italic, code, links, tables, lists, images
- **Syntax-aware cursor** — jumps between rendered and raw source in code blocks, tables, and lists
- **Full editing** — selection, copy/cut/paste, undo/redo, word and line operations
- **Persistent cursor** — restores position per file across sessions
- **Adaptive theming** — respects terminal light/dark background
- **Print mode** — render markdown to stdout without the editor
